During last weeks I've been working in a project where the data model specification
were being done by the product team using an Excel document.

I didn't feel confortable with this specification as macros didn't work properly
in my MacOS and it was hard to find the information required in each time.

So I've created a script that gets as input a CSV, easily exported from Excel, and
generates two output files:

- the class diagram that defines both entities and interfaces: it's done in two
phases. First create a text based file with the information required to use plantUML
and generate the graphics associated to the model.

- MediaWiki formatted files with the information of both entities and interfaces and
the links required between pages.

PlantUML is a drawing tool that can be use to generate sequence, use case, class,
activity diagrams...
